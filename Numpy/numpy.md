#### 1. itemset(*args) -
Insert scalar into an array

#### 2. item(*args) -
Copy an element of an array to a standard Python scalar and return it.

#### Use:
**item**  is very similar to a[args], except, instead of an array scalar, a standard Python scalar is returned.
This can be useful for speeding up access to elements of the array and doing arithmetic on elements of the array using Pythonâ€™s optimized math.
