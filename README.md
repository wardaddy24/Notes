# Notes


## The difference between the L1C and L2A products:
L1C products provide the top of atmosphere reflectances in fixed cartographic geometry. Images are tiles of 100 sq. km and the products contain applied radiometric and geometric corrections.
L2A products provide bottom of atmosphere reflectances in cartographic geometry. This product is currently processed by ESA using a processor running Sentinel-2 Toolbox.
