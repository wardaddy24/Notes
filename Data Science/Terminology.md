## Gini index:
{ Gini Index }=1-\sum_{j}{ }_{\mathrm{j}}^{2} \
1. Gini Index is a metric to measure how often a randomly chosen element would be incorrectly identified.\
2. It means an attribute with lower gini index should be preferred.

## Latent Space:
1. The latent space is simply a representation of compressed data in which similar data points are closer together in space.\
2. Latent space is useful for learning data features and for finding simpler representations of data for analysis.\
3. We can understand patterns or structural similarities between data points by analyzing data in the latent space, be it through manifolds, clustering, etc.\
4. We can interpolate data in the latent space, and use our model’s decoder to ‘generate’ data samples.\
5. We can visualize the latent space using algorithms such as t-SNE and LLE, which takes our latent space representation and transforms it into 2D or 3D.
