## Predictive Modeling:

Predictive modeling, also called predictive analytics, is a mathematical process that seeks to predict future events or outcomes by analyzing patterns that are likely
to forecast future results.
** Example: **
Bayesian spam filters use predictive modeling to identify the probability that a given message is spam. In fraud detection, predictive modeling is used to identify
outliers in a data set that point toward fraudulent activity. And in customer relationship management (CRM), predictive modeling is used to target messaging to customers 
who are most likely to make a purchase.

## There are four assumptions associated with a linear regression model:

1- Linearity: The relationship between X and the mean of Y is linear.
2- Homoscedasticity: The variance of residual is the same for any value of X.
3- Independence: Observations are independent of each other.
4- Normality: For any fixed value of X, Y is normally distributed.

##  There are four assumptions associated with a logistic regression model:

1- The Response Variable is Binary
2- The Observations are Independent
3- There is No Multicollinearity Among Explanatory Variables
4- There are No Extreme Outliers
5- There is a Linear Relationship Between Explanatory Variables and the Logit of the Response Variable
6- The Sample Size is Sufficiently Large
