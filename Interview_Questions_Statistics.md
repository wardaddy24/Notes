**Q.1 In what situation would you consider mean over median?** <br>
Ans *To use the median when the the distribution of data values is skewed or when there are clear outliers.* <br> 
<br>

**Q.2 For sample size n, the margin of error is 3. How many more samples do we need to make the margin of error 0.3?** <br>
Ans ***Margin of error is proportional to 1/sqrt(N)*** <br>
3 *sqrt(n)/sqrt(n_new) = 0.3<br>
sqrt(n) /sqrt(n_new) = 0.3/3 = 0.1<br>
sqrt(n) = 0.1*sqrt(n_new)<br>
**square both sides**<br>
n = n_new *0.1^2 = 0.01*n_new<br>
n_new = n/ 0.01 = 100n<br>
**so you have to take 100 times as many samples.How many more?**<br>
100n - n =99n samples more<br>
**99n samples more is the answer**<br>
so you cannot say how many as a number unless you know the original n<br>
so if n_orig= 50 , then 99*50 = 450 more<br>
<br>

**Q.3 What is the assumption of error in linear regression?** <br>
Ans *Linearity: The relationship between X and the mean of Y is linear.<br>
Homoscedasticity: The variance of residual is the same for any value of X.<br>
Independence: Observations are independent of each other.<br>
Normality: For any fixed value of X, Y is normally distributed.*
<br>

**Q.4 Given data from two product campaigns, how could you do an A/B test if we see a 3% increase for one product?** <br>
Ans *Check for the variation from the control. Run some offer for a number of days or increase the trial/availability for the other product.Theoritcal question subjected to type of product*
